This is a simple GUI-based implementation of John Conway's Game of Life,
written in C# using the .NET framework. Build with Visual Studio 2017.

* Left-click on the grid to fill in cells, right-click to clear them.
* Patterns can be saved and restored via the menu.
* The speed setting controls the simulation speed in ticks per second (1-100).

I did this mainly as an exercise to learn C#, so it's nothing particularly
special (but it's quite functional if you want to play!).
